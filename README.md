Google Music API (.NET Framework)
========================

An unofficial robust and full implementation of Google's Play Music API for the .NET Framework.

This is still a work in progress - documentation will be here once this is complete.

This repository also includes a simple UI that demonstrates some of the core functionality of the API.

You may use my API as you wish - all I ask is that you give a little credit.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
